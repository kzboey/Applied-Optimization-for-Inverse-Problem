# Homework

This folder must be used for your homework assignments. You must create
one subfolder for each homework. Each subfolder should contain examples,
writeups, code, images and anything you find relevant to solve your homework.

Finally, before each deadline for the homework (usually the next lesson), you
must create a git tag for your most recent commit, and publish it, such that we
can see it at the start of the lesson. We will use these tags to review your
homework and have an overview of your work at each point in time.
